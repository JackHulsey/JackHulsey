Hi! My name is Jack Hulsey and I'm a senior studying Computer Science and Mathematics at St. Lawrence University

Iâ€™m currently focused on algorithmic analysis and web development, and Iâ€™m working on a project that ranks football teams using complex linear algebra. As the Captain of the Nordic Ski team at St. Lawrence, Iâ€™m really making the most of my time in Canton!
